# NetRivals JS Test

*Design and implement the view mocked up in the image above. With special attention to the dotted box, in which you must design and implement a Vanilla JS state-based component that allows the user (a store owner) to edit and save a mathematical formula to be applied to its products' prices.*

**Take into consideration:**

● The component should have an "edit" mode
● The component should have a "display" mode
● The user should be able to cancel the changes being made to a formula
● The component should handle the validation of the mathematical formula
● Some products should already have a formula applied
● Use semantic HTML
● Make it responsive
● Don't worry about using the right images and fonts, placeholders are fine
